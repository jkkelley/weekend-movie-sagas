## Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

## Installation

1. Create a database in Postico named "saga_movies_weekend"
2. The queries in the [database.sql] file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.

3. Open up your editor of choice and run "npm install" in the root directory of project
4. Run "npm run server" in the root directory of the project to get the server up and running.
5. Run "npm run client" in the root directory of the project to get the app up and running.
